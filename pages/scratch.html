            <h1 class="heading">My Unicycle Challenge</h1>
            <p class="text">It was a <span class="story">hot summer day</span> in the first week of June, I was just getting home from marching band practice around 4pm when I saw my brother's unicycle lying there. I thought maybe I could learn to ride it. 
            </p><p class="text">Although I was pretty tired from being outside all day, I decided to pick it up and give it a go. I steadied myself on the wall of my house and mounted the unicycle. I steadied myself against the wall as I attempted my first couple peddles. This was the start of a unique skill that I have. I spent the rest of the week learning how to unicycle, every day after practice I would spend one extra hour on the unicycle before heading inside.</p>

            <h3 class="heading">Mountain Unicycling</h3>
            <p class="text">Other great things you can do on a unicycle is mountain unicycling. My brother would take his unicycle up the canyon and ride on the mountain bike trail back down. It is a little more dangerous, but very fun. Just like how unicycling is different from biking, doing so in the mountains is very different from mountain biking. Why? Because there are a few differences between bikes and unicycles.</p>
            <ol class="bullets text">
                <li>Front and back balance</li>
                <li>No coasting with your feet on the pedals</li>
                <li>No brakes</li>
                <li>No handlebars</li>
                <li>No steering with your hands</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text">These differences make it really hard if you are only used to mountain biking, like me, so I never tried it even though I think it is sick. I remember watching videos with my brother about people doing tricks and unicycling in the mountains.</p>
            <p class="text">Watch this inspiring video about someone unicycling on a mountain bike trail.</p>

            <p class="text">Videos like these are so cool! But the coolest thing about unicycling is unicycling parkour. Just like bike parkour, you can do it on a unicycle, and if you know tricks, it is even better. <a href="#tricks">Go to a list of tricks</a>. I made a game using AI that does unicycle parkour. You will jump over benches and avoid frisbees as you try to get the highest score.</p>
            <a class="heading" href="../pages/AI page.html">Play the unicycle game?</a>
            <p class="text">Here is one last experience: I suddenly became an odd kind of cool because I could unicycle. It's a neat skill that makes you kind of cool. If I were placed on a coolness scale, I would be in the same zone as Nick on this scale. An above-average coolness.</p>
