                            <p>My first global experience was a ten day humanitarian service trip to the Dominican Republic. We served, made filters, built homes, and worked alongside the people in their humanitarian businesses and we celebrated, worshiped, and danced with them according to their culture. I religiously served the people of the Ivory Coast. I lived how they lived, ate, talked, and danced how they did. I participated in their culture while teaching about Jesus Christ for two years. I am participating in a BYU business study abroad this summer where we will travel to three world capitols and visit dozens of business. We will live with them for nine weeks as we study and learn at their enterprises.</p>

                    <p>I love my family, my church, nature, and to learn. I am actively involved in my church and will always serve and devote time for the Lord. I love a good spot of shade and some grass between my toes, hikes and picnics are how I stay refreshed. I am always trying to learn new things and especially new ways of looking at the world. Whether thats teaching myself to unicycle or participating in a different cultures traditions I am open eyed ready to learn.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I like to keep my past times compelling and uplifting, rather than going out to a bar for a soda I prefer to take a walk downtown and have a nice conversation. Rather than get caught watchin sports I prefer to chillax with a movie or better yet, a board game, where I express my competitive nature. I love a good laugh and I always look to see the good and beautiful among the ugly stones of life.</p>
